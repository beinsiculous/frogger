//! Browser entry point: fetch all assets into the engine's VFS, then run
//! the exact same game `main.rs` runs natively.
//!
//! On wasm the engine's save-path strings are localStorage keys, so the
//! same save code persists achievements, high scores, and input bindings
//! in the browser (contract: the engine repo's `docs/WEB_SAVES.md` —
//! `beinsiculous.games.frogger.*`, values byte-identical to the native
//! JSON files, `insiculous-save` events fired for the site to observe).
//!
//! With `--features editor` the same library builds a SECOND bundle, served at
//! `/playground/frogger/`, that runs this game inside the engine's scene editor.
//! That bundle writes none of the `beinsiculous.games.frogger.*` keys above — an
//! editor session must not record achievements, scores or bindings the site's
//! boards read — and keeps its camera and panel layout in a slot of its own.
